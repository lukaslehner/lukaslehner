### Hi, I am Lukas 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I am a PhD candidate in Social Policy at the University of Oxford.

- 👨‍🔬 My resarch focuses on the consequences of labor market policies and institutions in a changing world of work. Examples include studies on the [Marienthal job guarantee](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cd25u/), reframing active labor market policy, and [labor market dualization](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/publications/no-2022-04-begging-thy-coworker-labor-market-dualization-and-the-slow-down-of-wage-growth-in-europe/).

- 👨‍🏫 I teach methods courses on statistics and causal inference, and I have developed a course on [reproducibility tools](https://www.gesis.org/fileadmin/upload/GESIS_Training/Syllabi_Methodenseminar/Fall_Seminar_2022/Fall_Seminar_2022_Week_1_Schulte-CloosLehner.pdf). I also teach substantive courses on social policy and comparative political economy, and I have developed a course on [economic policy](https://lukaslehner.github.io/assets/Syllabus_5970_WiPol.pdf).

- 🔑 Transparency and reproducibility are core values guiding my research. I aim to make my code accessible to the public.

- 😷 During the pandemic, I founded the [Oxford Supertracker](https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/) to assist researchers in navigating new data sources: https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/.

- 💻 You can find more info on my work on my website: https://lukaslehner.github.io/.

- 💡 The code for the website is publicly available in the [repo](https://github.com/lukaslehner/lukaslehner.github.io), which several researchers have forked to build their own website.
